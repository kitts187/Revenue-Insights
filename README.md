The project is about an imaginary hotel chain called AtliQ Grands.

AtliQ Grands

They owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 

AtliQ Grands is losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category due to competitive pressures and poor management decisions. 

To address this, the managing director plans to implement "Business and Data Intelligence" strategies.

Lacking an in-house data analytics team, they have decided to hire a third-party service provider to analyze their historical data and provide insights.

As a data analyst, I have been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard for the task.

My objectives are to:

1. Design a dashboard in alignment with the stakeholders' mock-up.

2. Generate additional relevant insights beyond those specified in the metric list and mock-up dashboard.


The mock-up dashboard file is attached in the end of this article.
